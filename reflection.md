On the topic of the DH, I had actually read through many of the DH awards submissions last year because my partner (who also encouraged me to take this class!) was a nominee last year.
The COVID-19 Cartography submission was interesting for a number of reasons.
Upon loading the page, it demostrates how vital curation can be, especially when trying to be bridge between micro and macroscopic data.
While the focus is understandably the visualizations, the data is more than a little overwhelming, having only a small link to the GitHub page to gain better context as to what the data actually is.
However, once you understand the context of the data, it could be quite valuable in evaluating the scientific priorities of various regions, as well as the research areas that tend to follow other subjects.
Having previous been unaware of the use of hamster in COVID-19, I was very surprised to notice them being one of the larger subjects in that map, but it prompted further research into unexpected areas.
While I note this isn't really palatable to someone of the general public, as in failing as digital public history, I could see it being a valuable background research for looking into how different countries' research focuses diverged.

Much of the focus for digital history, at least many of the tools we've gone over and in the readings, seem more focused on the macroscope.
Especially with the sheer amount of the data available or creatable, it's very easy to get caught up in the macroscopic position.
Even the research focused on a single person's correspondence in Michelle Moravec "Visualizing Schneemannn American Art History and Digital Scholarship: New Avenues of Exploration" became very macroscopic in the research.
Even in the DH Awards submissions, the focus appears heavily on the macroscope.
However, this submissions for the Best Use of DH for Public Engagement seem to break this trend and focus very heavily on the microscopic histories, especially through digital storytelling.
