Though I think I did the regex tutorial correctly, I still opted to download the premade file just in case I did something wrong that I missed.

When I attempted to load the data, I initially went through the key collision method.
In this, the metaphone3 function was the only one that successfully found a single collision.
Even switching to nearest neighbor, I wasn't finding any clusters without setting the values so high that everything was becoming clusters.
At the end I got the source table down the 152.
That said, my data from part 2 won't load in properly (there appears to be some formatting issue with the CSV I made) and the provided data appears to be precleaned.

Going through the recipients, I'm even more confident the data is precleaned, as the only clusters found were Secretaries of State and it was down.

I think I roughly know what's going on under the hood from my ML classes, but it's really interesting to see it being used for not outright CS-y things.
